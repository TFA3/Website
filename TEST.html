        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello my name is Thomas Ashton I have always had a fasination with software and web development since I started taking classes in<br>
            in highschool. I spent six years in the US Navy after highschool as an Electronics Technican on Nuclear equipment onboard submarines<br>
            during this time I developed strong skills with electrical and electronic equipment. Additionally to this I helped setup, develop <br>
            and run a database for more than 1000 different items onboard the submainre keeping track of all part numbers and serial numbers. <br>
            This database also maintained status of all equipment and had reports for all issues, defieficinies repairs and changes made to equipment.<br>
            I also helped populate, ran and maintained two servers and various programs that allowed the submainre to operate and maintain status<br>
            effectivly. After the US Navy I started working for General Dynamics Electric Boat Corpration as an Electrical Technican for various <br>
            non-nuclear systems onboard submainres, perforing inital acceptance testing and test procedures on the equipment ensuring that it adaquetly<br>
            operated. While doing this I started attending college at Three Rivers Community College where in May of 2023 I obtained my Assoicates in<br>
            Computer Science Technology and a Certificate in Data Analytics. After working as an Electrical Technican I moved on to work in Electric Boat<br>
            as a Nuclear Test Electrical Engineer which including performing acceptance testing on electronics and electrical equipment related to nuclear<br>
            operations onboard new construction submarines. Finally at my time as an Electrical Engineer I have help implement a database to keep track of<br>
            all cabling systems on the submarine, integrating a user interface that allows for searching using a variety of different items. Another database<br>
            I developed is to help keep track of system status, integrating Visual Basic code and JavaScript to allow for electronic signatures using <br>
            PKIs which validate the signatuers and ensure that proper objective quality evidence is provided for the status of the equipment. Computers<br>
            have always excited me and I am looking to take my plethora of skills in many different fields and combine them to the best of my abilities<br>
            as a software developer, data analysis or web developer, all of them excit me and I have experience with all of these fields.
